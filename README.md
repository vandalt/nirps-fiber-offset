# NIRPS Fiber Placement Calculations

This notebook helps calculate fiber placement when observing off-axis targets with the NIRPS AO.

**This is not a detailed guide on how to control the offsets at the observatory**, only a helper notebook to calculate desired guiding offsets once you know how to offset the fiber.

## Installation

1. Create a new Python environment (optional, but recommended): e.g., `conda create -n nirps-fiber-offset python`
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate nirps-fiber-offset`
3. Install required packages: `python -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

Open the notebook and follow the instructions in there!
